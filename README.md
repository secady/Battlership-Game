# Battleship-Game
This is the first project that I did during the Data Science Bootcamp. 
To watch the demo, please refer to the file "Battleship Game_Testing 6.mp4".
To run the game on Python, please use the script file "py_main.py".

The objective of this project was to familiarize students with Python which is a required programming skill in the Data Science field. I was given 2 weeks to complete this task.
