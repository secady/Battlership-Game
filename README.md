# Battleship-Game
This is the first project that I did during the Data Science Bootcamp. 
To watch a demo, please check out this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8QvrUPZe3E.
To run the game on Python, please use the script file "py_main.py".

The objective of this project was to familiarize students with Python which is a required programming skill in the Data Science field. I was given 2 weeks to complete this task.
